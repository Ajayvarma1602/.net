Q3.
A man has Rs 480 in denomination of 1 Rupee, 5 Rupee and 10 Rupee and all are equal. What are total no of notes required?

    Let number of notes of each denomination be x.

          x+5x+10x=480

          16x=480

            x=30.

   Therefore, total number of notes required will be =3x

                                                     =3*30 

                                                     =90.
